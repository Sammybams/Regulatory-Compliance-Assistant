      Rules:
      - Top-level "articles" must be an array of objects of the form {"article": <int>, "paragraphs": [<int>, ...]}.
        Example: [{"article": 1, "paragraphs": [1,2,3]}, {"article": 2, "paragraphs": []}]
      - All article and paragraph values must be integers (>=1). For "Article 5(a)" return 5. Do NOT convert Roman numerals.
      - "sectors" must be chosen from the canonical list exactly (strings). If none match, return an empty array.
      - Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema (no commentary).
